2017-10-24	Bully: Review: Bully's Incisive Rage Wins on 'Losing' 	parse error	"As rock star origin stories go, Alicia Bognanno's may be the only one that begins like a LinkedIn testimonial. ""If everybody worked as hard as Alicia then everybody's records would be Number One hits,"" her old boss Steve Albini said to NME in 2015, after she interned at his Electrical Audio studio. Bognanno eventually switched from working the soundboard to the vocal booth with the formidable band, Bully. With guitarist Clayton Parker, drummer Stewart Copeland and bassist, Reece Lazarus, their 2015 debut Feels Like was a shot in the indie rock arm. Their big anthem, ""Trying,"" brimming with Pixies energy and the whizzing rhythms of the Deal sisters, proved Bognanno wasn't padding her Nineties alt-rock resume. And her glorious caterwaul? Just the cherry on top.          Former Steve Albini intern talks analog catharsis, meeting Kim Deal        Bully are strong enough musicians they could have made a great follow up coasting on their effortless guitar-bass teeter. But on Losing, Bognanno emerges as a wry lyricist, dissecting the clashing impulses that arise after heartbreak, like Dorothy Parker fronting a new wave band. It takes punk gall to deliver an opening like: ""Well it's a new year and you've made it clear you don't want to see me/ I don't get it, but I don't care"" (""Guess There"") or ""The thought of your death was overwhelming/ I could've talked but I just rolled over instead"" (""Either Way""). Well, Caligula would have blushed. ""Kills to Be Resistant"" is a vivid new take on the Cure's ""Pictures of You,"" where Bognanno scrolls through her iPhoto Library, talking a big, fake game about maintaining healthy distance and respect. It's the kind of shallow mood-boosting that would melt the glitter clean off Robert Smith's brow line. On ""Running,"" the band mirrors these tensions with gently dissonant peaks and valleys – occasionally subsuming Bognanno's voice in the process. But all the lonely festering serves another important purpose. Bully's newfound vulnerability and over-earnestness (""unproductivity haunts me!"") creates a wedge between them and their cynicism-prone Nineties influences. By delving inward,  they carve a path forward."	3.5
2017-10-23	 Margo Price Shifts Focus Outwards on Ambitious, Political Second Album	parse error	"Little more than a year after Midwest Farmer's Daughter became one of the most widely-praised country debuts of 2016, Margo Price is back with All American Made, her most ambitious work yet. Having staked out her own backstory and crafted her rabble-raising mythology on her debut, Price shifts her focus outwards at a heartland ravaged by sexism and poverty. After an opening series of expertly crafted country pastiches, All American Made indeed evolves into one of the most political country records in years, a declarative honky-tonk manifesto of small-town farmer populism and working-class feminism.   Pulling off an explicitly socially conscious record that also makes for a raucous dive-bar soundtrack is no easy feat, but Price makes it work by sticking close to classic country songcraft, regardless of the subject matter. Infusing her country with a blend of blues-based R&B, orchestral girl-group pop and psychedelic-leaning indie rock, Price employs deft Nashville wordplay on ""Weakness"" and ""A Little Pain,"" while songs like ""Heart of America"" and ""Pay Gap"" remain faithful to the restless, weary voices of her down-and-out protagonists.   ""Women do work and get treated like slaves since 1776,"" she sings in the latter. Price is too smart and careful a writer to succumb to crowd-pleasing polemics, instead insisting in writing with a novelist's sharp ear for how her characters might actually be processing what it means to live in a country run by a sexual predator.         Elsewhere, the 34-year-old singer spins more harrowing autobiography on ""Do Right By Me"" and ""Wild Women."" Throughout she pays tribute to heroes like Petty, Levon and Willie, the latter of whom even joins Price for a tearjerker duet on ""Learning to Lose."" Like Nelson's best Seventies work, Price's latest is both reverent and revolutionary, a traditional-minded statement that nevertheless blazes an urgent path forward."	3.5
2017-10-18	 St. Vincent Bites Back on Pop-Indebted 'Masseduction'	parse error	"""The void is back and unblinking,"" Annie Clark sings with icy vulnerability above a tendril of a synth note that floats in waves beneath Masseduction's opening song ""Hang on Me."" On Clark's fifth studio album as St. Vincent, the virtuosic indie-rock singer and guitarist dives further into the void, obliterating herself with sex, drugs and power. This album, a partnership with top pop whisperer Jack Antonoff, is a masterpiece of confrontational intimacy, and Clark lays herself bare as only a woman who has seen her life suddenly become tabloid fodder can. Clark is no stranger to evoking the visceral. Her twisty, distorted 2014 self-titled LP was a tight, colorful leap forward, much showier than her intimate 2011 breakthrough, Strange Mercy. St. Vincent was released around the time the deeply private Clark began a high-profile relationship with super model and tabloid fixture Cara Delevingne. Clark bites back at the gawkers and curious lurkers, even baiting them with a clandestine feature from Delevingne under the name ""Kid Monkey"" who sings ""Pills to wake/Pills to sleep/Pills, pills, pills every day of the week"" like she's taunting on a playground. Later, Clark teases listeners with the cheekily titled ""Young Lover,"" a brutal bass-bumper where she relays a tale of said young lover being found in a bathtub after overdosing on – drum roll, please – pills. It is the most direct Clark has ever been with her lyricism, savagely cutting to the core of her feelings and her own mythology. On ""New York,"" one of the year's finest singles, she thrives in simplicity, pining for the loss of ""the only motherfucker in the city who"" could handle her. In ""Los Ageless,"" she finds herself lost in Hollywood's labyrinth of ""sunset superstars"" and ""lost sages"" she finds at the bar above a menacing, gothic New Wave beat, losing all sense of her East Coast nostalgia. Clark's more tender moments cut through some of the album's carnal darkness. The sweet piano ballad ""Happy Birthday, Johnny"" feels almost inappropriate to listen to, like you're intruding on a private conversation between Clark and the troubled subject, ""wherever you are,"" as she sings. On ""Slow Disco,"" a mess of strings coalesce with one of her more understated vocal performances, as she offers a slow dance with a ghost. Clark's campy expedition through the void ends on a delicate goodbye. It's a Rocky Horror Picture Show ""Rose Tint My World""/""Don't Dream It, Be It"" medley of an exit. Clark embodies both theatrical tragedy and hope, jumping into the pool with her demons and saviors for ""Smoking Section,"" a quietly heartbreaking tune that dares you to jump in with her. ""And sometimes I go to the edge of my roof/And I think I'll jump just to punish you,"" she dejectedly sings in the deepest part of her register. Here she is again, a ""casualty hanging on from the balcony"" as she self-describes in ""Sugarboy,"" knowingly dangling her pain for the hungry audience. ""It's not the end,"" she repeats ad infinitum at the song's own end. Surely, it's only the beginning of the story Clark is willing to tell."	4
2017-10-13	 Beck Gets Back to Having Fun With Chrome-Plated Funk of 'Colors'	parse error	"Throughout Beck's nearly 25-year career, his finest moments – oddball hip-hop hits like ""Loser"" and ""Where It's At,"" the 1999 funk romp Midnite Vultures, the 2014 folk-rock dark horse Morning Phase – have mixed sincere musical crate-digging with winking self-awareness. It's a balancing act that can easily tilt into cheap parody, and while many artists have followed Beck's lead (Father John Misty being the most prominent recent example), few have done it with Beck's range, wit or soul. Which is why Colors is so welcome; it's a brilliant attempt to reckon with – and put his own stamp on – modern pop in the late 2010s. The result is his most straight-ahead fun album since the Nineties. The first signs of his new project surfaced in 2015 with the glistening ""Dreams"": funky, chrome-plated rhythm guitar with multifarious vocals – falsetto, wildly pitch-shifted – ricocheting like spotlights off a disco ball amid Eighties electro-pop and Seventies stadium-rock flourishes. Over those carpet-bombing hooks, our hero declares himself ""about a lightyear from reality,"" shouting out a girl (likely his paramour, Marissa Ribisi) who's making him high. The 2016 single ""Wow"" found him higher still, with red-eyed trap beats and a kaleidoscope of whistling tones, Beck rhyming ""jujitsu"" and ""girl with a Shih Tzu"" with a baked old-school flow. The funniest stoner jam in ages, it was a long way from the moony Morning Phase, but no less compelling.  Both of those songs are highlights of Colors, but so is nearly every track, in terms of off-kilter pop craftsmanship. The title song matches an ocarina-tone melody with cyborg hand claps and vocals apparently jacked from Melle Mel's ""White Lines."" With its music hall piano, ""Dear Life"" nods to both the Beatles and late indie-folk virtuoso Elliott Smith. It's a reminder of the tradition Beck comes out of, as is ""I'm So Free,"" whose title he enunciates to resemble ""I'm so fake,"" while brightly snarling chord changes recall Nirvana at their most shamelessly inviting.  It's a sign of the respect Beck commands that his Colors collaborator is Greg Kurstin, the superstar producer-writer who helped Adele create ""Hello"" – roughly the 21st century's biggest pop hit. (The men also have history: Kurstin was a keyboardist on Beck's 2002 Sea Change tour.) Together, they jam-pack each song with sonic ideas, even as they zero in on pop simplicity.          The title of the strangely haunting ""Fix Me"" recalls a certain big-box Coldplay ballad, likely not by accident. With pretty bell-tone flourishes, its standout verse declares, ""I want you, I want you, I want you, oh, I want you."" Trite? Arguably. But clichés are clichés for a reason. And in the right hands, the everyday can feel utterly fresh and essential all over again. Which is exactly what happens here."	4
2017-10-13	 Pink Keeps Energy High, Vitriol Catchy on 'Beautiful Trauma'	parse error	"Pink was dominating the charts with spunky,  real-talking anthems back when today's slow-sad divas were in preschool, and her  seventh LP is a reminder of that. The title track and the strummy ""Whatever  You Want"" are vintage Pink, with juicy hooks and pop-rock muscle; ""I  Am Here"" underscores its EDM-powerment message with a gospel choir. Trauma's  chilled-out middle sags, but ""Revenge,"" her bad-romance duet with  Eminem, is an early shot of energy; Max Martin and Shellback's homage to Dr. Dre's  skip-step beats may be too on the nose, but Em's rhymes nicely recall a time  when even lunatics rode bright hooks."	3
2017-10-12	 Great Indie Talkers Kurt Vile and Courtney Barnett Have Conversational Collabo	parse error	"Here are two great indie-rock songwriters getting together to spool out autumnal guitar prettiness and converse about life, art and whatever. As collaborators, they're a perfect match: Kurt Vile is a master of zoned-out fingerpicking and droll longhaired jive; Courtney Barnett is a Dylanesque image ninja who can turn everyday stuff like making ramen noodles into rich, personal meditations. The idea of a Kurt and a Courtney making a record has a darkly funny resonance but the Nineties fantasy-rock pairing they really evoke is Stephen Malkmus and Liz Phair, the languid guitar surgeon and the causally incisive lyrical realist.             On  the dappled ""Over Everything,"" they trade lines about songwriting  strategies and tinnitus over beautifully bent riffs, and whistle and whoo-hoo  their way through the relaxed country rock of ""Blue Cheese,"" which  shouts out a weed dealer named Tina and free-form radio hero Tom Scharpling.  The pair do a song by Barnett's partner, Jen Cloher (the Crazy Horse-style  aloneness anthem ""Fear Is Like a Forest""), and tenderly duet on Belly's  1993 deep cut ""Untogether."" Most endearing is ""Continental  Breakfast,"" a jangle-folk ode to their friendship; Vile sings about weird  shit he's been thinking and walks he's been taking, and Barnett chimes in, ""I'm  feelin' inferior on the interior."" It's like buddies at the bar, or  a 2 a.m. text thread. They make each other feel better."	3.5
2017-10-06	 Marilyn Manson Gets Back to His Shock-Rock Roots	parse error	"Two years after releasing the surprisingly mature goth-metal offering The Pale Emperor, Marilyn Manson has returned to straight-ahead shock. ""I write songs to fight and to fuck to,"" he sings on ""Je$u$ Cri$i$,"" from his 10th LP, over spiky, electro-hard-rock riffs that occasionally recall his glammy Mechanical Animals period. That old black magic often sounds forced, but he makes up for it with a few more melancholy tracks, the best of which, ""Saturnalia,"" is an eight-minute ode to orgiastic revelry that feels like a long-lost descendant of Bauhaus' ""Bela Lugosi's Dead."""	3
2017-10-06	 Kelela's Forward-Thinking R&B; Is Restlessly Innovative	parse error	"Since her 2013 mixtape Cut 4 Me, Kelela has been one of R&B's most buzzed-about up-and-comers, an enigmatic presence who melds her strong yet acrobatic voice and bottomless fascination with music's potential into hooky, forthright post-millennial soul. Kelela has, in the last year, dueted with Solange on A Seat at the Table's crystalline ""Scales"" and added her voice to Gorillaz' cacophony of Humanz. Her debut full-length fuses together jagged textures, vaporous synths and her versatile voice into forward-thinking R&B animated by its restless innovation. She luxuriates in her upper register over the woozy haze and heavy beats of ""Jupiter,"" funhouse-mirrors her voice around the gulping wobble of ""Blue Light"" and uses icy arpeggios and unnerving chord changes to soundtrack her soul-wringing on ""Take Me Apart."" The nervy ""Truth or Dare,"" meanwhile, shimmies while Kelela beckons, its robo-electro backbone updating Timbaland's skittering ideal for the 21st century – and, probably, beyond."	3.5
2017-10-06	 Open Mike Eagle Offers Impressionistic History Lesson	parse error	"Motormouthed rapper Open Mike Eagle has gotten raves  for albums that explore the comedy of neurosis. His new one, easily his  headiest, is a concept LP built around Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes, a famously  mismanaged housing project destroyed 10 years ago. Eagle impressionistically  inserts himself into events real and imagined. ""We live in a space that  should have never existed,"" he raps. The results add a historical angle to  hip-hop's powerful mix of the personal and political."	3.5
2017-10-06	 Liam Gallagher Sticks to Oasis' Brawny Britpop and Beatle-esque Melodies on Solo Debut	parse error	"It may be the closest Liam Gallagher has come to apology. ""In my defense all my intentions were good,"" the ex-Oasis singer asserts on his solo debut, in a song that shares its title with Buffalo Springfield's ""For What It's Worth."" ""But I am a dreamer by design,"" Gallagher adds, as good a description of kamikaze stardom as anything he sang in Oasis, from his brother Noel's songbook. Eight years after that band's messy breakup, Liam puts his signature voice on the line in a mostly original set of strut and reflection that sticks to Oasis' template – brawny Britpop, Beatle-esque ballads – and often invigorates it.     Like his  brother, Liam openly quotes his inspirations: ""She's so purple haze""  (the suitably dreamy ""When I'm in Need""); ""Angels, gimme  shelter/Cause I'm about to fall"" (the harder, thumping ""You Better  Run""). There are fresh twists on the classicism too: the slashing-riff  charge and falling-vocal chorus in ""Greedy Soul""; Gallagher's  scouring bray swimming through the acid-folk ""Chinatown."" As You Were lacks one Oasis specialty –  straight-up helter skelter. But if the album is a few steps shy of his old  band's best, it has Gallagher writing like he means it and singing like his  dream isn't over."	3.5
2017-10-05	 Torres Sings Unsparing Meditations on Desire on Latest LP	parse error	"Singer-guitarist Torres' 2015 breakout, Sprinter, was  a stirring study in spiritual reckoning. Her latest is even more raw, offering  conflicted images of emotional and physical release over bracing  industrial-rock textures co-produced by Rob Ellis (PJ Harvey). The harsh,  predatory ""Skim"" spools through questions like ""Did he hold your  hips with authority?"" as if weaponizing betrayal, and on ""Three  Futures,"" she seems to give breaking up an almost religious significance  over a spare melody that flickers like a dying prayer candle."	3.5
2017-10-05	 Synth Experimentalist Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith Gorgeously Maps the Life Cycle	parse error	Pastoral synthesizer landscapist Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith  broke out last year with Ears, an acclaimed set of Terry Riley-esque  gurgles and flutters, using noise to evoke nature. On her sixth LP, The  Kid, a concept album about the human life cycle, she paints an even  lusher world using cosmic swoops, squelches and lots of her highly processed  vocals. Sounds don't align with the rhythms, and Smith's voice is awash in  alien echoes. But as challenging as this avant-garde music is, it's also warm,  absorbing and gorgeous.	4
2017-10-04	 Demi Lovato Shows Off Her Brassy Firepower on 'Tell Me You Love Me'	parse error	"Demi Lovato is at her pop-princess best when her  majestic wail takes over, as the high points of the singer's sixth album  attest. The title track channels the brassy clamor of her 2015 smash ""Confident""  into maximum-overdrive R&B; ""Sexy Dirty Love"" throws back to the  robo-funk era, with Lovato using its fluid bass line as a springboard for vocal  pyrotechnics. The LP gets bogged down in chilled-out trap pop (see the Lil  Wayne-​assisted ""Lonely""). But slow jams like ""Concentrate""  perfectly balance the downtempo and the energetic."	3
2017-10-04	 Wolf Alice Deliver Noise-Rock Seduction on Second LP	parse error	"All hail Wolf Alice, four U.K. twentysomethings who have not gotten the memo about rock not mattering anymore. On a second album that dares to both sprawl skyward and focus its volume introspectively they fashion clouds of guitar noise into a crown for singer-guitarist Ellie Rosewell. It glitters seductively, but it will draw blood if you step to her wrong. There's Rosewell on ""Don't Delete the Kisses,"" monotoning like a Pet Shop Boy over a pulsing beat about being too shy to grab the love that's right in front of her, and there she is on ""Yuk Foo"" screaming like a hardcore heroine about wanting to fuck everyone she meets. Bassist Theo Ellis and drummer Joel Amey turn rhythmic thunder into dubwise moments of clarity, freeing guitarist Joff Oddie to punch a hole in the space-time continuum, as waves of swamp-rock reverb give way to sci-fi squalls, meditation chimes and chandeliers of starshine. Oddie's guitar is a compass pointing in every direction at once. Rosewell favors melodies that feel like shouts even when they're whispers. She grapples with a predatory world that steals happiness and loved ones, and creates demands from within and without. Attention wanders during the wizardy fingerpicking of ""After the Zero Hour,"" but production from Beck bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen ups the focus throughout, even on the seven-minute title track, which slips from Sabbath sludge into surging space rock and back again. This is music that merges raw physical pleasure and dreamscape explorations. The stakes are high, and the payoffs are real."	4
2017-09-29	 Kamasi Washington Follows Up Acclaimed 'Epic' With Tidy Yet Complex EP	parse error	"California sax virtuoso Kamasi Washington became the world's hottest jazz musician with 2015's The Epic, a three-disc opus of funky, labyrinthine wailing longer than Apocalypse Now. His first release since trips to Coachella, Bonnaroo and the BET Awards is a tidy EP under 32 minutes, but it still manages to cover plenty of ground. Debuted as part of the 2016 Whitney Biennial, five short numbers warmly flirt with gentle Brazilian flourishes, smooth jazz and a slinky sound that feels like glossy Seventies funk fusion. However Side B's 13-minute ""Truth"" may stand as his greatest song-length achievement, a mash-up of the other five pieces that crescendos and cascades like Pharoah Sanders' Black Unity meets Godspeed You! Black Emperor."	3.5
